This is a Windows Phone 7 app I wrote to keep track of gas mileage.  It was written using an early version of the SDK, before database storage
was available, so storage is done using a flat-file binary format.  I stopped maintaining it long ago.  Feel free to fork
it, learn from it or make it your own.
